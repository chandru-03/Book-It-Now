My jokes are loosely based on my life but highly exaggerated to hide the rather mundane reality. If you have watched my videos and enjoyed them, you should buy a ticket and come watch me because I have not uploaded these jokes anywhere online. If you haven't watched my videos, you should buy tickets too. But if you have watched my videos and didn't enjoy them, you should probably skip this show. It's okay, you will find other comedians you do enjoy.\n About the artist Anand Rathnam is a civil engineer turned stand up comedian performing since 2015. Having loved and lost, and having repeated this cycle multiple times, he is now convinced that he knows life better than anyone. Anand's brand of comedy is observational and opinionated, mostly drawn from his real life experiences. Over exposure to his comedy is not at all injurious to the listener but can some time cause existential crisis. Anand has performed in many places across South India like Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mumbai etc and also has been part of India's premier comedy festival called the Bengaluru Comedy Festival where he performed alongside some of the biggest comedians in India.`,
